There are two algorithms made available for performing WPCA.
Both algorithms have been made based on the PCAW algorithm by Kiers.

Psychometrika 62(2) 251-266

PCAWX is the algorithm where the column offsets of the entire data matrix are estimated.
PCAWXC is the algorithm where the column offsets of the data block of each individual are estimated.

Both algorithms require the properly centered data, together with the calculated center as an input.
